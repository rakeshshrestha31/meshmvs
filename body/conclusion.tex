\section{Conclusion}

We propose a neural network based solution to predict 3D triangle mesh models of objects from images taken from multiple views.
First, we propose a multi-view voxel grid prediction module which probabilistically merges voxel grids predicted from individual input views.
We then cubify the merged voxel grid to triangle mesh and apply graph convolutional networks for further refining the mesh.
The features for the mesh vertices are extracted from contrastive depth input consisting of rendered depths at each refinement stage along with the predicted depths.
The proposed mesh reconstruction method outperforms existing methods with a large margin and is capable of reconstructing objects with more complex topologies.
% Our system exploits the recent developments on multi-view depth prediction to inform the mesh generation process and obtains state-of-the-art performance.
% We also present a novel method for aggregating features from multiple images which takes into account the importance of each view for predicting different parts of the objects.
